"""
Given number n and two permutations p and q of length n. Find a permutation r, such that for every 1 <= i <= n, q[i] = p[r[i]].
Permutation of length n is an array consisting of distinct numbers from 1 to n in some order.
Example
Input:
n = 3, p = [3, 1, 2],  q = [2, 1, 3]
Output:
r = [3, 2, 1]
[input] integer n
length of the permutations
[input] array.integer p
[input] array.integer q
[output] array.integer
permutation r
